# Top 5 Resources For Learning About Maker Governance

Have an idea about how to make MakerDAO better?

Submit it to governance!

As an active experiment in progressive decentralization, MakerDAO is constantly developing and implementing new processes to maintain and expand the Maker ecosystem.

Anyone can participate in governing the Maker Protocol, but the fact that anyone *can* participate doesn't mean it's easy to navigate the process.

Fortunately, we've got a list of helpful resources for learning about how governance works in MakerDAO and what you can do to get involved.

Here are the top 5:

## #5 Maker Relay
